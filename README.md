## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

#### Spacy Installation Errors

If you see errors like:
```
Failed to build spacy
ERROR: Could not build wheels for spacy, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects
```

Try these solutions:

1. **Update pip first:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Install build dependencies separately:**
   ```bash
   pip install wheel setuptools cython
   pip install spacy --no-build-isolation
   ```

3. **Use the Conda installation method:**
   Use the `./setup_conda.sh` script which handles these dependencies better.

#### Docker Build Issues

If you encounter errors when building the Docker image like:

```
ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
```

This is typically caused by a version mismatch between numpy and packages that depend on it. Try these solutions:

1. **Use the pre-built image** (recommended):
   ```bash
   docker pull dinexora/iridoveda:latest
   docker run -p 8501:8501 dinexora/iridoveda:latest
   ```

2. **Build with the fixed Dockerfile**:
   The repository includes an updated Dockerfile that fixes these compatibility issues by:
   - Installing numpy with a fixed version first
   - Installing spacy with the `--no-build-isolation` flag
   - Directly downloading the spacy language model from GitHub

3. **Clean Docker cache and rebuild**:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up
   ```

#### Missing Language Model Errors

If you encounter errors related to missing spacy language models:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Runtime Issues

#### Qdrant Connection Problems

If the application can't connect to Qdrant:

1. Check if the Qdrant container is running:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep qdrant
   ```

2. Start Qdrant if it's not running:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
   ```

3. Ensure the environment variables are set correctly:
   ```bash
   export QDRANT_HOST=localhost
   export QDRANT_PORT=6333
   ```

#### Image Processing Errors

If you encounter errors when processing iris images:

1. Check if OpenCV is installed correctly
2. Verify that the image is a valid iris image
3. Try processing a different image to see if the issue is with a specific file
